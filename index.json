How are these features further transformed? In the primate, researchers have argued that a key transformation is ?figure-ground segmentation.? Behaviorally, humans can delineate figures from backgrounds using only kinetic borders independent of low-level texture cues. Neurally, long-latency enhancement of responses in early visual areas to regions within figure compared to background has been reported. Do mice also show behavioral and neural signatures of figure-ground segmentation? We trained mice on a figure-ground segmentation task where figures were defined by gratings and naturalistic textures, moving counterphase to the background. Unlike primates, mice were incapable of figure-ground segmentation using kinetic borders alone. While mice could report the location of gratings, they were at chance for figures defined by naturalistic textures. Remarkably, mice could learn to localize naturalistic texture-defined figures after many weeks of training, but when tested on new textures, were unable to generalize. This suggests a strategy of memorizing a lookup table of noise patterns, a cognitively impressive feat. We also recorded visual responses to the same stimuli in V1, RL, and LM using both 2-photon imaging and electrophysiology. Neural responses were consistent with the behavior, revealing robust position decoding from neural populations for gratings but not naturalistic textures. Lastly, we simulated neural responses using a model of V1 incorporating orientation-dependent suppression, and a deep network, VGG16. While the former model failed to reproduce the neural results, the latter model was successful. Interestingly, the best model for mouse V1 neural data came from mid to late layers. Taken together, these findings reveal a fundamental difference between primate and mouse mechanisms for object segmentation, showing that orientation contrast is critical for object perception in mice, unlike in primates.","tags":null,"title":"A fundamental difference between rodent and primate object vision","type":"talk"},{"authors":["L.

Here we combine multi-site, semi-chronic, intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the human limbic system with machine learning methods to discover a brain subnetwork that correlates with variation in individual subjects' self-reported mood over days. First we defined the subnetworks that influence intrinsic brain dynamics by identifying regions that showed coordinated changes in spectral coherence. The most common subnetwork, found in 13 of 21 subjects, was characterized by beta-frequency coherence (13-30 Hz) between the amygdala and hippocampus. Increased variability of this subnetwork correlated with worsening mood across these 13 subjects. Moreover, these subjects had significantly higher trait anxiety than the 8 of 21 for whom this amygdala-hippocampus subnetwork was absent. These results demonstrate an approach for extracting network-behavior relationships from complex datasets, and they reveal a conserved subnetwork associated with a psychological trait that significantly influences intrinsic brain dynamics and encodes fluctuations in mood.","tags":null,"title":"An Amygdala-Hippocampus subnetwork that encodes variation in human mood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

One hypothesis is that this process -- termed 'task engagement'- may enable context-dependent behaviors. Here we set out to determine 1) whether the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a role in task engagement, and 2) how task engagement relates to the context-dependent processing of auditory cues in male and female mice performing a decision making task that can be guided by either auditory or visual cues. We found that, in addition to auditory ERP suppression, task-engagement is associated with increased mPFC activity and an increase in theta band (4-7 Hz) synchronization between the mPFC and auditory cortex. Optogenetically inhibiting the mPFC eliminates the task engagement-induced auditory ERP suppression, while also preventing mice from switching between auditory and visual cue-based rules. However, mPFC inhibition, which eliminates task engagement-induced auditory ERP suppression, did not prevent mice from making decisions based on auditory cues. Furthermore, a more specific manipulation - selective disruption of mPFC outputs to the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus - is sufficient to prevent switching between auditory and visual rules, but does not affect auditory ERPs. Based on these findings we conclude that: (1) the mPFC contributes to both task engagement and behavioral flexibility; (2) mPFC-MD projections are important for behavioral flexibility but not task engagement; (3) task engagement, evidenced by the suppression of cortical responses to sensory input, is not required for sensory-cue guided decision making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen rodents perform choice-selection tasks based on sensory cues, neural responses to these cues are modulated as compared to task-free conditions. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon depends on the prefrontal cortex, and thus represents a form of top-down regulation. However, we also show that this phenomenon is not critical for task performance, as rodents can make decisions based on specific sensory cues even when the task-dependent modulation of responses to those cues is abolished. Furthermore, disrupting one specific set of prefrontal outputs impairs rule switching but not the task-dependent modulation of sensory responses. These results show that the prefrontal cortex comprises multiple circuits that mediate dissociable functions related to behavioral flexibility and sensory processing.","tags":null,"title":"Roles of prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus in task engagement and behavioral flexibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

In accordance with previous studies of cortical circuits, we found that prefrontal microcircuits in young adult mice spontaneously generate many more stereotyped sequences of activity than expected by chance. However, the key question of whether these sequences depend on a specific functional organization within the cortical microcircuit, or emerge simply as a by-product of random interactions between neurons, remains unanswered. We observed that correlations between prefrontal neurons do follow a specific functional organization-they have a small-world topology. However, until now it has not been possible to directly link small-world topologies to specific circuit functions, e.g., sequence generation. Therefore, we developed a novel analysis to address this issue. Specifically, we constructed surrogate data sets that have identical levels of network activity at every point in time but nevertheless represent various network topologies. We call this method shuffling activity to rearrange correlations (SHARC). We found that only surrogate data sets based on the actual small-world functional organization of prefrontal microcircuits were able to reproduce the levels of sequences observed in actual data. As expected, small-world data sets contained many more sequences than surrogate data sets with randomly arranged correlations. Surprisingly, small-world data sets also outperformed data sets in which correlations were maximally clustered. Thus the small-world functional organization of cortical microcircuits, which effectively balances the random and maximally clustered regimes, is optimal for producing stereotyped sequential patterns of activity.","tags":null,"title":"Correlations between prefrontal neurons form a small-world network that optimizes the generation of multineuron sequences of activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

Attention normally increases the sensitivity of neural populations to incoming signals by decorrelating ongoing cortical circuit activity. Here, we investigated whether mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be disrupted within deep layer prefrontal circuits in mouse models of autism. We isolated deep layer prefrontal circuits in brain slices then used single-photon GCaMP imaging to record activity from many (50 to 100) neurons simultaneously to study patterns of spontaneous activity generated by these circuits under normal conditions and in two etiologically distinct models of autism: mice exposed to valproic acid in utero and Fmr1 knockout mice. We found that modest doses of the cholinergic agonist carbachol normally decorrelate spontaneous activity generated by deep layer prefrontal networks. This effect was disrupted in both valproic acid-exposed and Fmr1 knockout mice but intact following other manipulations that did not model autism. Our results suggest that cholinergic modulation may contribute to attention by acting on local cortical microcircuits to decorrelate spontaneous activity. Furthermore, defects in this mechanism represent a microcircuit-level endophenotype that could link diverse genetic and developmental disruptions to attentional deficits in autism. Future studies could elucidate pathways leading from various etiologies to this circuit-level abnormality or use this abnormality itself as a target and identify novel therapeutic strategies that restore normal circuit function.","tags":null,"title":"Putative microcircuit-level substrates for attention are disrupted in mouse models of autism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Here we report that in mouse PFC, D2Rs are selectively expressed by a subtype of layer V pyramidal neurons that have thick apical tufts, prominent h-current, and subcortical projections. Within this subpopulation, the D2R agonist quinpirole elicits a novel afterdepolarization that generates voltage fluctuations and spiking for hundreds of milliseconds. Surprisingly, this afterdepolarization is masked in quiescent brain slices, but is readily unmasked by physiologic levels of synaptic input which activate NMDA receptors, possibly explaining why this phenomenon has not been reported previously. Notably, we could still elicit this afterdepolarization for some time after the cessation of synaptic stimulation. In addition to NMDA receptors, the quinpirole-induced afterdepolarization also depended on L-type Ca(2+) channels and was blocked by the selective L-type antagonist nimodipine. To confirm that D2Rs can elicit this afterdepolarization by enhancing Ca(2+) (and Ca(2+)-dependent) currents, we measured whole-cell Ca(2+) potentials that occur after blocking Na(+) and K(+) channels, and found quinpirole enhanced these potentials, while the selective D2R antagonist sulpiride had the opposite effect. Thus, D2Rs can elicit a Ca(2+)-channel-dependent afterdepolarization that powerfully modulates activity in specific prefrontal neurons. Through this mechanism, D2Rs might enhance outputs to subcortical structures, contribute to reward-related persistent firing, or increase the level of noise in prefrontal circuits.","tags":null,"title":"Synaptic activity unmasks dopamine D2 receptor modulation of a specific class of layer V pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

This approach allows GAL4 to be replaced with any other sequence, placing different genetic effectors under the control of the same regulatory elements. Using InSITE, GAL4 can be replaced with LexA or QF, allowing an expression pattern to be repurposed.
